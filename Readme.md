Random Hacks of Storytelling: RHOST
===================================

Introduction
============

RHOST is a collaborative way to write stories through github. But it is also a game. The more pull requests (PR) accepted, the more RHOST points you earn. It will initially run for one week.

> NOTE: If you are taking the App Inventor course for credit, you will need at least two RHOST points to complete this lab exercise.

How does it work?
=================

### Instructions
Fork this repo. We will follow the same workflow explained in the [App Inventor
development workflow](http://josmas.github.io/AppInventor2DevelopmentWorflow/#/) slides.
Clone to your local and make a feature branch. Now pick a file (or more). If no one has touched the file yet, it will contain two words. Add at least 3 sentences of content related to the 2 words (you can add as much content as you want, additional files if you want, code, whatever you can think of!)

If the file already has some content, that means that someone else has modified that file before you did. The idea is the same anyway; add 3+ more lines to the story, commit, push and open a PR.

PRs will be merged as they arrive, but only if the can be cleanly merged. If there are any conflicts (because someone else modified the file in the meantime) the PRs will be closed (check your notifications if you want to know what happens). If you get a PR rejected, you need to get your files up to date by pulling from the main repository, merge, fix conflicts (if any), and submit another PR.

PRs will not be merged if their content is not appropriate (you will be notified
of this).

You should always keep your master branch clean, and work on feature branches. Only one PR per feature branch will be accepted. Once it is accepted, you can delete your local feature branch.

### Rules
- the master repo cannot accept two PRs in a row from the same person.
- PRs cannot come from your master branch (you have to work on a feature branch).
- two different PRs cannot come from the same feature branch (pull up to master and fork from there).

> NOTE again: If you are taking the App Inventor course for credit, you will need at least two RHOST points to complete this lab exercise.

### Rewards
Get in the RHOST hall of fame - for the first time ever!

FAQ:
====

**What kind of content can I add?**
Anything related to the main topic (the two initial words), or any other existing content in each particular file.

**Is there a limit in length for content?**
No.

**Can I modify more than one file at a time?**
Certainly.

**Can I add source code?**
Yes. You can also add additional files, if it makes sense to do so.

**Are there any limitations about transforming the files?**
No. Whatever you can do with git, you can do with the files.
